# directory for project involving RSA of color-word Stroop

## ./in
* contains behavioral data assembled by stroop-rsa/write_behav_stroop_rsa.R.
* no other script writes to this directory.
* underlay surfaces downloaded from BALSA: https://balsa.wustl.edu/sceneFile/show/7qP5m

## ./code
* primary analysis pipeline (bash, .R scripts)
* dynamic reports (.rmd files)
* reads from ./data, nil-bluearc (for 3D+t images), ./out
* writes to ./out
* __./behav__: scripts / reports for generating behavioral analysis (RT and accuracy)
* __./group__: scripts / reports for generating group-level analyses
* __./indiv__: scripts / reports for generating individual difference analyses (brain~behavior)

## ./out
* all output of scripts are directed to this directory
* the one exeption is output related to fMRI GLMs, which is saved within __./glms__
* __./rsa__
  * __./mods__: representational similarity models generated by define_models.R
  * __./obsv__: observed similarity matrices. saved as arrays within .rds files.
  * __./stats__: subject level fits and group statistics, saved in long-form .csvs
* __./summaries__: various summary tables (.csvs) for QC, misc analyses, and things that might be read into a manuscript file.
* __./masks__: functionally or anatomically defined brain masks, created by scripts within __./code/masks__
* __./behav__: output of scripts / reports for generating behavioral analysis (RT and accuracy)
* __./group__: output of group-level analyses
* __./indiv__: output of individual difference analyses (brain~behavior)

## ./glms
* contains AFNI GLM input (e.g., stimtime and movreg files), shell scripts, and output (e.g., .nii brick files)
* 3D+t images read from nil-bluearc
* GLMs fit on ccplinux1, and results merged with local directory via rsync
