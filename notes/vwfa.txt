VWFA

left posterior / lateral occipitotemporal sulcus

from colin hoy / kevin weiner

	"In terms of VWFA, for sure, we have maximum probability ROIs. They are published in the paper below. There are 2 and they are located in different cyto territories: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~kweiner/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Weiner2017_CerebCortex.pdf

	Independently, Gari has a PNAS paper showing that both areas are very consistent also in relation to white matter: https://www.pnas.org/content/115/42/E9981/tab-figures-data)."
